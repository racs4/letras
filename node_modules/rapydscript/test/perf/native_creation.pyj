# Performance tests for various native functions. Unlike other modules in
# this directory these tests are not representative of RapydScript itself,
# but they're useful to understand when writing new modules or baselib
# functionality for RapydScript. When possible, replace the slower logic
# with more performant equivalents. Keep in mind that performance may vary
# somewhat depending on platform-specific implementation, I would ignore any
# differences smaller than 20% for that reason.
